# Data Runner

## Overview

Data Runner is a game in which your character searches a library environment for a player-specified metric. When the character finds the specified metric, the metric's value is added to the player's score. You can add Data Runner to your Datadog dashboard as a widget. 

This extension is made possible by [Datadog apps][4] which extends the user-interface with third party content not supported natively. If you are interested in extending your Datadog experience for business or for fun, you can [build out an app or game of your own][4].

For more details about Data Runner, see [stuartlangridge/data-runner][1] on GitHub.

2. Use the **+ Add Widgets** button to open a list of available widgets. Drag and drop the Data Runner widget into your desired position on the dashboard.

3. Choose a metric for the game character to find.
