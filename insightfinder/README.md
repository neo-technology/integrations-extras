# InsightFinder

## Overview

[InsightFinder][1] AIOps identifies system and application issues before they impact users. Powered by unsupervised machine learning, InsightFinder continuously learns from events, logs, metrics, and changes to detect anomalies, predict incidents, and remediate outages.

InsightFinder ingests data from Datadog through standard APIs and finds anomalous events before your business is impacted.
