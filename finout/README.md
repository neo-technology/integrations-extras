# Finout: The Modern cost Observability platform for FinOps

## Overview


[Finout](https://finout.io) combines cloud providers, data warehouses, and CDNs in one bill, creating a business context view of your cloud spend in minutes.

Finout’s cloud cost management tool uses your container metrics to break down Kubernetes costs without installing an agent. You can connect to any metric within Datadog and create a unit cost to improve cost observability.

Finout’s Datadog app allows you to add cost widgets into your Datadog dashboards and combine your AWS, Snowflake, Kubernetes, and Unit costs alongside your usage.

## Setup

### Installation

If you don't have a Finout account yet, [sign up](https://finout.io/start-now) for a free trial. After you accept the account invitation, you are set to start working with the Finout Application in Datadog, no code needed. 

For a Kubernetes-level cost breakdown or a unit cost based on a Datadog metric, contact Finout Support in the Finout application or email [support@finout.io](mailto:support@finout.io).

### Configuration

1. Install the app from the Datadog tile.
2. Add the Finout widget to your dashboard.
3. Authenticate your Finout account.
4. Configure the following widget parameters:
    - Usage type (Cost, Total Coverage, RI, SP, Spot, or On-Demand)
    - Chart type (Bar or Line)
    - Context (Select the Finout business context you want to visualize).
    - View (Select which Finout saved view you want to visualize).
5. Continue adding more Finout widgets!

## Support

**Note:** When looking at AWS cost, you may need to expand the timeframe of your query to at least one week because AWS cost and usage reporting are always two days behind.
